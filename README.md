# cobot-19
A discord bot which graphs current statistics relating to Covid-19.

**Invite: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=690568808154398772&scope=bot&permissions=51200**

Check `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

Orca must be installed and running as a local server, I personally use docker as it's easy to setup. (https://github.com/plotly/orca)


To use the bot, first create a file named "token.txt" and insert your bot token into it, then run `run.sh`.
Obviously you will need a bot account and have invited the bot to your server.
